│   └── feature/ci-cd-setup
├── hotfix/urgent-fixes
└── release/v1.0.0
```

### **Environment Strategy**
```
Development → Staging → Production
    ↓           ↓          ↓
   Local     Railway    Railway/AWS
   SQLite    SQLite     PostgreSQL
```

### **CI/CD Pipeline Stages**

#### **1. Build & Test Stage**
